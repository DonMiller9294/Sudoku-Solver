## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudoku-solver.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd sudoku-solver
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the Sudoku Solver GUI:

```bash
python sudoku_solver_gui.py
```

The GUI window will appear, and you can enter your Sudoku puzzle numbers. Click the "Solve" button to see the solution.

## How It Works

The Sudoku Solver uses a backtracking algorithm to fill each cell with a valid number and recursively explores all possible combinations until a solution is found. The algorithm checks if the number is already in the row, column, or the 3x3 grid, ensuring that each cell adheres to Sudoku rules.
